# The Campaign: Mission
Modern technology was supposed to unlock material abundance, unleash creative spirits, and highlight global cultural diversity. Social media promised us interconnection, but left us lonelier than ever; sci-fi authors of the 90's envisioned colonizing Mars by 2025, yet domestic air travel increasingly threatens our collective sanity. We dreamt of utopia, but built a nightmare.

It doesn't have to be this way. The Campaign is a collective of workers in the tech industry using the powerful tools at our disposal to forge a brighter future.

The tech industry's capabilities are unparalleled in human history, but they're directed toward the ends of hyper-individualism, consumerist materialism, and short-term profit-seeking. Orienting technology away from these false idols won't be easy but, for the sake of our families, our communities, and ourselves, we have to try.

To that end, The Campaign is building a network of solidarity and mutual accountability inside and outside our workplaces, with the goal of aligning technology toward the common goods of family, community, and nation.

From engineers to cafeteria cooks, customer support operatives to product designers, The Campaign is connecting workers of all stripes in service of a shared mission: to reclaim technology and build the future we always dreamed of.

## Why hasn’t anyone tried this before?
The Campaign takes inspiration from tried-and-true models of labor relations around the world, with the German model as our primary influence. In 2022, when compared to American workers, German workers worked 22% fewer hours while taking home 2 percentage points more of GDP (i.e. German workers earned more while working less). This is due in large part to two factors:

**Sectoral bargaining:** When workers across an entire industry are organized, they are better able to set standards across all employers. The universal approach means workers can expect some level of consistency when changing jobs, and companies don’t need to compete by racing to the bottom on wages.

**Board co-determination:** Workers are represented in the decision-making processes of corporations by holding positions on company boards and establishing "works councils." This fosters collaborative relationships between shareholders, management, and workers.

In essence, the German approach leads to a stronger partnership between workers and employers. The Campaign does not believe that worker and employer interests are always and everywhere at-odds. If aligned toward positive ends, the corporate structure can facilitate the development of new technologies, provision of high quality services, and a general increase in quality of life. But this must be accomplished in a way that respects the full humanity of every stakeholder.

## If this job bothers you so much, why don’t you leave and get a new one?
The Campaign rejects the premise of this question. Many of us have put years of effort into building our companies - why should we need to leave to improve our conditions?

Besides, the things we’re looking for aren’t found in most corporate jobs. Changing employers might net us a nice pay raise, but it won’t necessarily give us a larger say in how we use our productive energies. 

## That's nice and all, but what does The Campaign actually do?
Members of The Campaign are...
- Leading drives for workplace democracy. While the tech industry has a reputation for sky-high compensation, power and profit still accumulate at the top.
- Caring for our coworkers in uncertain times. Whether a friend was unjustly fired or a division of the company was shut down, we're helping ease the pain and stress of at-will employment.
- Forming reading groups to study philosophy, economics, and history. To change the course of technological development, we need to understand the systems that got us here in the first place.
- Organizing physical fitness and sports groups. From run club to fight club, we're building our collective strength, stamina, and self-discipline.
- Developing each other's professional skills. Members of The Campaign take our work seriously; we up-level each other through talks, seminars, and writing about our learnings, hacks, and experiments.

## How can I join The Campaign?
The Campaign is open to any and all workers who are serious about building for the common good. See https://linktr.ee/campaignxyz for more details
