# The Campaign: Block
The recent announcement of a company-wide reduction in force (RIF) has caused widespread dread, listlessness, and pessimism. We feel powerless against the small, unaccountable group of bosses who can unilaterally revoke our employment. Without a moment's notice, our incomes can be rescinded, our health insurance terminated, and our family's lives thrown into disarray. 

Some of us have put our heads down, running ever faster on the hamster wheel to save our jobs. Others have checked out of work entirely, "resting and vesting" (or even working a second job) until a manager notices. 

Both of these reactions are tragic in their own ways. A life full of anxiety about the thought of losing a job is no life at all. And we all deserve meaningful jobs that restore our vitality, not sap it.

At Block, The Campaign will center on three overarching goals:

**Building worker solidarity.** The Campaign is a way for us to connect on our own terms, outside the office and off company-run platforms. Our relationships at work are among the strongest we'll build anywhere, too important to be left to the whims of our employer.

**Represent workers in decision-making bodies like the Board of Directors.** We are building the future together, so we should all be privy to the conversations happening at the company's highest levels.

**Improving coordination between workers and the company.** Management should not be able to instantly terminate our employment. Large-scale layoffs should be negotiated and planned with worker representatives. Myopic managers should be rooted out and replaced with galvanizing leaders.

It's time for solidarity.
